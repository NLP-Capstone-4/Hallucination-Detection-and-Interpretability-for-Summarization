5,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O W O O O O M,"The dialogue is about Hannah asking for Betty's number to Amanda, who couldn't find it and suggests to ask Larry for it since he had called her(Betty) the last time they were in the park together. Hannah doesn't know him(Larry) well and is shy to text him, but Amanda asks her to do it anyway.  So according to the summary, ""Amanda will ask Larry about it"" is incorrect. The way to correct this information is the token Amanda can be changed to Hannah. This is Wrong Reference (W) from the tokens described above. All other tokens are correct and are thus Not Hallucinated (O). The summary is missing the information that Hannah is shy to text Larry, hence the tag M at the end."
63,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O C O O O O O,"The conversation is about Wanda wanting to throw a party and needing Gina's help to do the groceries. Gina is unsure if she can use her father's car but agrees to ask. Wanda suggests doing the groceries on Friday and Gina agrees to ask her father about the car. The summary states that Gina will go with Wanda to do groceries on Friday. However, in the conversation, Gina only agrees to ask her father about the car and does not confirm that she will go with Wanda. Therefore, the token ""will"" is a Circumstantial error (C) as it does not accurately reflect the uncertainty in the conversation. All other tokens are correct and are thus Not Hallucinated (O)."
