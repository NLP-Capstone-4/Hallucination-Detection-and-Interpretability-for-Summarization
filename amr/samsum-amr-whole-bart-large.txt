Hilary: Sounds good. We'll be having lunch with some French people (the ones who work on the history of food in colonial Mexico - I already see you yawning your head off)
Benjamin: YAAAAWN ðŸ™Š Where and where are you meeting?
Hilary: So I'm meeting them at the entrance to the conference hall at 2 pm and then we'll head to this place called La Cantina. Italian cuisine, which is quite funny, but that's what they've chosen
Benjamin: Interesting ðŸ˜± To be honest, Hilary, I almost feel like changing my mind. Wanting to take this nap might end up costing me to dear
Hilary: Oh come on ðŸ˜‚
Benjamin: All these terrible obstacles on mu way to bed might just prove to much to take
Hilary: We'll try to avoid talking about their subject of research. Oh wait, no, I'm actually meeting them because I wanted to chat about their research lol
Elliot: ðŸ™‰
Hilary: Do join us, we're going to have fun. And then you'll take the keys and take this most deserved of naps
Elliot: Sounds like a plan ðŸ˜‚
