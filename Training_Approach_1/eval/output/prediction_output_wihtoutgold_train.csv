Clara : That's the name of the radio show the main character , Sam , presents on college radio . Neela : Yeah , but why is it so good ? Clara : Well , it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there , which I find very interesting . The characters are strong and likeable too . Neela : I suppose it's rather different from the UK , then ? Clara : It seems so , as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here . It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students , which gets out of hand . Neela : How's that ? Clara : Well , obviously , the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy , Reggie , gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student . It may be at another party , though , I'm not sure of that . Neela : Oh , that sounds pretty strong stuff . What else happens ? Clara : Well , there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist . He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies . Neela : Well , I must say , it does sound good , I'll check it out soon !
