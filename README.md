# Hallucination-Detection-and-Interpretability-for-Summarization

## This branch contains the work for 2-step training for approach2

## To replicate, follow these steps:

1. Run the joint-learning_step1.ipynb on the annotated bad summaries to train the classifier only.

1. Run the samsum_exp1.ipynb to train the model on both losses for good summaries.
